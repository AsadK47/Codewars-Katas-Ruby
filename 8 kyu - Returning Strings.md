# Task
Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; 
your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

[Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]

# My solution
```ruby
def greet(name)
  "Hello, #{name} how are you doing today?"
end
```
