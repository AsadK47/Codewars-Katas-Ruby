Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. 
If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

# Solution
def lovefunc( flower1, flower2 )
  if flower1.even? && flower2.odd? or flower1.odd? && flower2.even?
    return true
  else
    false
  end
end

# Better / Factored solution
def lovefunc( flower1, flower2 )
  (flower1 + flower2).odd?
end
